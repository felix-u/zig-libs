# zig-libs

Single-file public domain (or BSD-3-Clause) Zig libraries.

Every `.zig` file contains its own documentation.

You can do anything you like with these public-domain libraries. Attribution is appreciated, but you have no legal
obligation.

If you would prefer BSD-3-Clause, every source file contains an explicit dual-licence for you to choose from.
