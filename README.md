# zig-libs

Single-file public domain (or BSD-3-Clause) Zig libraries.

Every `.zig` file contains its own documentation.

I target Zig's master branch. The first line of every `.zig` file contains the zig version with which it was last tested
and the date this occurred.

You can do anything you like with these public-domain libraries. Attribution is appreciated, but you have no legal
obligation. 

If you would prefer to use the BSD-3-Claus licencee, every source file contains an explicit dual-licence for you to
choose from.
